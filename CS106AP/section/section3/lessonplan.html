      <h2>Lecture and Concepts Recap</h2>
      <p>
        Check out the slides for full details, but here's a quick summary of
        everything that went down. In addition, make sure to take a look at the
        exercises students went through in class.

            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            We discussed the distinction between strings and integers
            (specifically, converting between them using the
            <code>str</code> and <code>int</code> constructors, although we
            called them functions). Following that, we discussed the loop-count
            pattern, namely:
          </p>
          <div class="codeblock">
            <pre class="python">
                  <code>
def count_char_occurrences(s, ch):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        c = s[i]
        if c == ch:
            count += 1
    return count
                  </code>
              </pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            Next, we talked about reading from a text file. In Python, this
            looks mostly the same as it does in Java, although with much cleaner
            syntax. Here's a toy example with all the important ideas:
          </p>
          <pre class="python">
                  <code>
def print_text_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f: # open a file in read mode ('r') and refer to it as `f`
        for line in f:             # read line up to and including newline character
            print(line, end='')    # each line is just a string, and we specify not to end with a newline when printing
    # file closes automatically at the end of the `with` block, so we can't read any more from it
                  </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Notice that students are now using the <code>print</code> function.
            This week, we'll be discussing the difference between printing and
            returning (i.e. side effects vs information flow), and how they are
            separate. A metaphor I like to use to explain this is the idea of a
            painter going into a room and painting the wall. Printing is the act
            of painting, and a return value is the painter coming back and
            telling you something about what they did inside the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, we moved onto running programs from the command line and
            PyCharm. On the former topic, we didn't discuss it in enormous
            amounts of depth, but rather just said to type the name of the
            script, followed by any command-line arguments (which we said was
            the information the script needed to run), like so:
          </p>
          <div class="codeblock">
            <pre class="bash">
                  <code>
$ python3 scriptname.py argument1 argument2
                  </code>
              </pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            We haven't discussed <code>sys.argv</code> yet, but will do so this
            week. That said, if students have questions about this, it's a good
            idea to review what exactly this line of code is doing. Here's a
            quick summary you could use:
          </p>
          <p class="quote">
            When setting up PyCharm on your computer, you installed Python 3.7.
            This is a program--just like Spotify or Google Chrome--which is able
            to read <code>.py</code> files and translate them into instructions
            (essentially 1s and 0s) that your computer can execute. Therefore,
            when you type <code>python3 scriptname.py</code>, you're telling the
            <code>python3</code> program you installed to read the code you
            wrote in <code>scriptname.py</code> and have your computer run it.
            In addition, your program might sometimes need additional
            information, like the filename in the crazy cat program. If that's
            the case, you specify that information (separated by spaces, if
            there's more than one bit of information) right after the name of
            the file. Your program can then access these bits of information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we talked about PyCharm and doctests. This is not the focus
            of this week's section, but students might have questions about how
            they work, so here, for reference and because I wrote this without
            thinking and don't want to delete it:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What's PyCharm? How is it different from Parlante.org?</li>
            <br />
            <p class="quote">
              Whenever you ran Python Code on Parlante.org, it was actually sent
              to a server somewhere else, and run on that computer before the
              results were sent back to you. From now on, you'll be running
              Python code on your own computer! PyCharm is a piece of software
              that allows you to edit your Python code, just like Microsoft Word
              lets you edit text documents. It's called an IDE (short for
              Integrated Development Environment), because it actually
              understands Python so can do cool things like identify problems
              with your code or suggest functions for you to use as you write
              them.
            </p>
            <li>What's a doctest?</li>
            <br />
            <p class="quote">
              Whenever we write a function, a crucial decision we need to make
              is what that function should return given a particular input. A
              doctest is a way of specifying the expected return value of a
              particular function on some inputs in the comments for that
              function. PyCharm makes it super easy to run your doctests to
              assess that your functions are behaving the way you want them to.
              You can specify doctests as below:
            </p>
            <div class="codeblock">
              <pre class="python">
                    <code>
def product(num1, num2):
    """
    Returns the product of num1 and num2

    >>> product(6, 7)
    42
    >>> product(8, 10)
    80
    >>> product(0, 100000000)
    0
    """
    # TODO learn math and write this function
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Provided your PyCharm interpreter is set up correctly, you can
              just right-click on this function and click 'run doctests' and see
              how many you passed.
            </p>

          <p>
            These lectures haven't happened yet, but below is a quick overview
            of the sorts of material we'll be covering:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <i>Style 2.0</i>: This involves coming up with a strategy to
                decompose your programs, as well as appropriately commenting and
                doctesting said functions
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <i>The <code>main</code> function and command line arguments</i>:
              These are in spirit similar to the <code>main</code> method in
              Java, although the syntax looks quite different. Here's a quick
              summary:

              <pre class="python">
                <code>
"""
argument_exploration.py
"""
import sys # for sys.argv

def main(args):
    print(args)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # any code here gets executed whenever the program is
    # run from the command line
    main(sys.argv) # sys.argv is a list of the command line arguments as strings
                </code>
              </pre>

              And here's what running that program would look like:

              <pre class="bash">
                <code>
$ python3 argument_exploration.py
["argument_exploration.py"]

$ python3 argument_exploration.py heartOfGold 42 textfile.txt
["argument_exploration.py", "heartOfGold", "42", "textfile.txt"]
                </code>
              </pre>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                <i>Lists</i>: Similar to <code>ArrayList</code>s in Java, lists
                in Python are variable-length ordered collections, with the
                nuance that they can store objects of any type (i.e. they're not
                homogenous). This week, we'll mostly be focussing on the
                following use cases:
              </p>
              <div class="codeblock">
                <pre class="python">
                      <code>
>>> lst = []                    # make a new list
>>> lst.append("arthur")        # add a new value
>>> lst.append("hitchhiker")
>>> lst.append("deepthought")
>>> lst[2]
"deepthought"                   # lists are 0-indexed
>>> len(list)
3                               # number of elements in the list
>>> for i in range(len(list)):
...     print(lst[i])
brahm
hitchhiker
deepthought
                      </code>
                  </pre>
              </div>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      As a rough heuristic, I'd spend more time on String Parsing than I would
      on the main function. If it comes to it, giving a conceptual overview of
      the main function is totally fine.
      <h4>String Parsing</h4>
      <p>
        The primary purpose of this problem is to introduce three mechanics, two
        of which are functional and the last of which is stylistic:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>The 'parse pattern' for a string</b>: Given a string with a
          particular symbol you're looking for and some substring of interest
          adjacent to that symbol, scan left or right from the index of that
          symbol.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Looping through a file</b>: Essentially, the loop explained in the
          file reading section of this handout.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Decomposition</b>: Deciding what parts of your solution you need to
          decompose into a function and strategically commenting/doctesting
          them.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>The <code>main</code> function </h4>
      The main goal of this problem is to introduce the mechanics of the main
      function, as well as to get some practice with working with lists and
      decomposition.
