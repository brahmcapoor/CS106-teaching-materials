        106AP this last week has been a rollercoaster of tricky concepts like
        nested for loops, functions and strings. This section is a great way for
        students to get a breather and make sure they understand these important
        topics.

      <h2>Lecture and Concepts Recap</h2>
      <p>
        Check out the slides for full details, but here's a quick summary of
        everything that went down. In addition, make sure to take a look at the
        exercises students went through in class.

            Neither of these lectures has happened at the time of writing, but
            will cover functions (specifically, exploring parameters and return
            values in more depth) as well as strings.

          <p>
            There are a couple of crucial ideas that are emphasized in lecture
            when it comes to functions: that variables with the same name in
            different functions aren't related and that the number and order of
            parameters passed in to a function must match that of the function
            declaration. Make sure your sectionees feel good about this.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the subject of strings, one crucial point is the idea that
            strings are immutable. Specifically, like all variables in Python,
            strings are mutable <i>references</i> to immutable String
            <i>literals</i> elsewhere in memory. While we can change what our
            variables <i>refer to</i> (i.e. the address they store), we can't
            change the objects stored at those addresses. Pragmatically
            speaking, the implication is that whenever you want to manipulate a
            string, you need to somehow construct a new string rather than
            changing the one you already have.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of your more enterprising students might question the
            immutability of strings, wondering why on earth Python's designers
            would foist us with such a limitation. While you don't have to go
            into a lot of detail and are welcome to defer the question to office
            hours or Piazza, here are a couple of quick answers you could give
            (some are harder to explain than others):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Since strings are fixed in size, it's easier to allocate the
              memory for them when they're constructed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since strings are immutable, Python can save memory by reusing
              string objects (for example, if two strings are both initialized
              to
              <code>'banter'</code>, they may well point at the same object in
              memory. You can verify this by using the
              <code>is</code> operator.) This is similar to String Pooling in
              Java, if you're used to that.
            </li>
            <li>
              Philosophically, Python considers strings 'elemental', just like
              floats or ints. Thus, to change a string is to change its very
              <i>essence</i> and so we might as well make a new string instead.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>
        This week's section handout has a wide variety of problems, all of which
        lend themselves well to a whiteboard-style section. The problems are
        detailed in greater detail following this, but as a general suggestion,
        I recommend working through the trace problem first, followed by a few
        string slicing or warmup problems as an introduction to Strings, and
        finally discussing a more advanced string problem.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first problem (only on the digital version of the handout) is an
          image algorithm review problem, for students who are still feeling
          shaky about images. You shouldn't do this in section, but point your
          students towards it if you think they'll find it helpful.
        </li>
        <li>
          The next problem is a trace problem! By far every student's least
          favorite kind of question in 106A, the pedagogical goals of problems
          like this are twofold. Firstly, they force a student to confront and
          reassess their own understanding of control flow and variable usage by
          tracing through a program's execution. Secondly, they allow a student
          to be more thoughtful about style, and to see how devastating a
          program with bad style can be through strategic hyperbole. Use this
          problem as a starting point for both conversations.
        </li>
        <li>
          The next two problems are both basic string problems, intended to help
          build a conceptual and practical foundation by showcasing common
          patterns such as the use of the <code>find</code> method and slicing
          syntax. I'd imagine this could be nicely integrated into a conceptual
          review of strings.
        </li>
        <li>
          The last problem is a collection of slightly more advanced string
          problems, intended for students to develop an algorithmic feel for
          strings. I'll leave it to you to figure out which is best for your
          section - adding commas to numeric strings is the most nitpicky,
          palindrome checker is the cheekiest and removing all occurrences is a
          nice compromise. One important idea to reflect on here is the idea of
          a for loop through a string's characters, and how that incredible
          common pattern is a result of the immutability of strings.
