@realDonaldTrump: Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the ‚ÄúSpecial‚Äù Counsel because the public understands that there was no  Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous), that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation &amp; that the only Collusion was with the Dems!
