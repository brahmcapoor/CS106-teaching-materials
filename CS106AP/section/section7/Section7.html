          In this week's section handout, we're covering a variety of different
          topics: tracing, graphics, sorting, and dictionaries amongst others.
          It'll also have you engage in some basic analysis of the output of
          your assignment 6's Mimic program to convince yourself it effectively
          models the text which it is fed as an input. Our goal is for you to
          gain a sense of how the programming skills you've been developing and
          are continuing to develop can be leveraged to solve some really
          interesting and realistic problems.

        <h2> Grid Drawing </h2>
        <p>
          Python is commonly used in industry and academia as a tool for
          managing and visualizing large amounts of data. Almost any
          visualization requires the use of some sort of grid on which you can
          orient your data. While Python has several toolboxes for producing
          such grids automatically, in this problem we'll work through manually
          making such a grid using the <code>tkinter</code> library. We'll
          primarily employ the following functions, which we reproduce here with
          the assumption that a <code>canvas</code> has already been created for
          us:
        </p>
        <pre class="python">
            <code>
# Draw a line between  (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), touching both
# optional: fill='red' to set color ('black' is default)
# optional: width=2 to draw a thicker line (1 is default)
canvas.create_line(x1, y1, x2, y2)
canvas.create_line(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill='red')
canvas.create_line(x1, y1, x2, y2, width=2)

# Draws text on the canvas.
# anchor=tkinter.SW means the given x,y is SouthWest corner of the tet
# of the beginning of the string. Other common choices are W (West) and NW (NorthWest)
# optional: fill='red' to set color ('black' is default)
canvas.create_text(x, y, text=a_str_value, anchor=tkinter.SW)
canvas.create_text(x, y, text=a_str_value, anchor=tkinter.SW, fill='red')
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p class="no-print">
          You can download the starter project for this problem
          <a href="draw-grid.zip">here</a>, which comes with a
          <code>main</code> function that's already outfitted to facilitate two
          behaviours:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            If your program is called with one integer command line argument
            (i.e. <code>python3 draw-grid.py 10</code>), it will produce a 500
            pixel x 300 pixel grid, separated into that many rows and columns.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your program is called with two integer command line arguments,
            (i.e. <code>python3 draw-grid.py 1200 800 25</code>), it will use
            the first two arguments as the dimension of the grid and the third
            as the number of rows and columns.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Your job is to complete the following function, which the
          <code>main</code> function will then call:
        </p>

        <div class="codeblock">
          <pre class="python">
                <code>
def draw_grid(width, height, n):
    """
    Divides a canvas into n rows and columns
    """
    # make canvas of specified dimensions
    canvas = make_canvas(width, height)

    # TODO: your code here

    # required line to put window on screen
    tkinter.mainloop()
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          The function begins by making a canvas (delineated by a blue border)
          for you to separate into a grid using the
          <code>make_canvas</code> function (which we provide), and ends by
          calling <code>tkinter.mainloop()</code> to put the window on the
          screen. It is your responsibility to actually draw the grid.
        </p>

        <h4>Milestone 1: Drawing column separators</h4>

        <p>
          We'll begin by first dividing the canvas into <code>n</code> vertical
          columns, which is accomplished by drawing <code>n - 1</code> vertical
          red lines between said columns, like so:
        </p>

        <img
          src="section7_img/section-7-1.png"
          alt="A grid"
          class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
        />

        <p>
          To determine the x-coordinate of each line, compute its position as a
          fraction of the entire width of the canvas, then multiply that
          fraction by the canvas width. This fraction will by definition be a
          number between 0 and 1, and thus will need to be represented by the
          <code>float</code> data type. In your own code, this likely means that
          you'll simply use the <code>/</code> operator rather than the integer
          division <code>//</code> operator which you might be more likely used
          to. Each vertical line should extend the full height of the canvas.
        </p>

        <h4>Milestone 2: Drawing row separators</h4>

        <p>
          Now, you'll do the same thing to draw separator lines for the rows of
          the grid to produce a window like this:
        </p>

        <img
          src="section7_img/section-7-2.png"
          alt="A grid"
          class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
        />

        <p>
          Each horizontal line should extend the full width of the canvas.
        </p>

        <h4>Milestone 3: Drawing labels</h4>

        <p>
          Finally, you'll label each of the row separation lines with its
          y-coordinate. Each label should be above and to the right of the
          leftmost end of the line, like so:
        </p>

        <img
          src="section7_img/section-7-3.png"
          alt="A grid"
          class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
        />

        <p>
          In <code>tkinter</code> nomenclature, we say that the anchor point for
          the label is <code>anchor=tkinter.SW</code>, which means that the
          coordinates we specify for the label are those for its SouthWest
          corner.

        <p>
          Write a program that draws a random number of circles of random sizes
          at random positions on the canvas. Be careful to make sure that none
          of the drawn circles are cut off by the edge of your canvas. You are
          provided with the constants <code>WIDTH</code> and
          <code>HEIGHT</code> (the canvas width and height, respectively),
          <code>RADIUS_MAX</code> and <code>RADIUS_MIN</code> (the
          maximum/minimum radius that each random circle may have), and
          <code>N_CIRCLES_MAX</code> (the maximum number of circles that may be
          generated in one run of our program. Note that each run should
          generate between 1 and <code>N_CIRCLES_MAX</code> circles inclusive on
          both ends). Specifically, your job is to implement the following
          function:
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">

        <br />
        <p>
          into which is passed a canvas and whose job is to do the random
          drawing of the circles. You might find the following functions
          helpful, some of which are found in the
          <code>random</code> module:
        </p>
        <pre class="python">
            <code>
# draws an oval on a canvas, the top left corner of whose bounding box
# is at (x0, y0) and the bottom right corner of whose bounding box is
# at (x1, y1)
canvas.create_oval(x0, y0, x1, y1)

# returns a random integer between lower and upper, inclusive of both
# bounds
random.randint(lower, upper)

# returns a random number between 0 and 1
random.random()

          the <code>lambda</code> technique:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Given a list of strings <code>strs</code>, sort the list
            case-insensitively (i.e. ignoring whether the word is upper or lower
            case)
          </li>
          <li>
            Given a list of strings <code>strs</code>, sort the list according
            to the last character of each string, case-insensitively.

          <li>
            Given a list of integers <code>nums</code>, sort the list according
            to the absolute difference between each number and 3.14. Python has
            an <code>abs</code> function, which takes as input a number and
            returns its absolute value, and which you might find helpful in this
            problem.

        <h2>Tweets Revisited</h2>
        <p>
          Recall the Big Tweets Data problem from last week, in which we worked
          with a <code>user_tags</code> dictionary whose keys were twitter
          usernames and whose values were additional nested dictionaries keeping
          track of the frequencies of Hashtag usage, like so:
        </p>
        <pre class="python">
            <code>
user_tags = {'@alice': {'#apple': 1, '#banana': 2}, '@bob': {'#apple': 1}}
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          One of the suggested extensions for this problem was to implement a
          function called <code>flat_counts</code>, which takes in a
          <code>user_tags</code> and returns a dictionary that counts the number
          of times each Hashtag is used, across all users. For example, calling
          <code>flat_counts</code> and passing the
          <code>user_tags</code> dictionary in as a parameter would lead to the
          following behaviour:
        </p>
        <pre class="python">
            <code>
>>> flat_counts(user_tags)
{'#apple': 2, '#banana': 2}
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Now, armed with your new toolkit for sorting, your job is to implement
          the following function:
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
          <code>def most_used(flat_counts)</code>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          which takes in a 'flat' dictionary as described above, and returns the
          most frequently used hashtag in the dataset. With a solid
          understanding of how <code>lambda</code>s can be used in sorting, you
          should be able to solve this in just a few lines of code. As a hint,
          dictionaries have a built-in <code>items()</code> function that
          returns a list of <code>(key, value)</code> tuples.

        <p>
          A rogue Cal student has somehow gained access to a computer on
          Stanford premises and as a misguided attempt to demonstrate their
          technical superiority, has left an ill-intentioned program -- a
          'Pynary bomb' -- for us to deal with. Left unchecked, there's no
          telling what this program might do: perhaps it'll delete the 106AP
          website and all your hard work on the assignments, or perhaps it'll
          constantly post low-quality content to SMFET, diluting Stanford's
          cultural credibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately for us, that student underestimated both your tenacity and
          skill with Python, and it's up to you to save the day. Your mission,
          should you choose to accept it, is to trace through the student's
          program (reproduced below) and to figure out the set of command line
          arguments that 'defuse' the bomb.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The author of this program is malintentioned, without question, but
            is not duplicitious. The functions they've written are at least
            good-faith efforts in implementing the behaviour their names
            describe, although they might not always succeeed.
          </li>

            The bomb will not resist any attempts by you to make its workings

        <h2>Analyzing Mimic Output</h2>
        <p class="hint">
          Thanks to Sheridan Rea for suggesting this problem!
        </p>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          One of the programs you'll have written as part of assignment 6 is
          called Mimic, in which you examine a piece of text and associate
          individual words with those that might follow them. In doing so, you
          gain the ability to generate new text by continuously choosing new
          words from the ones you previously selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          This program involves constructing what is called a
          <i>Markov Model</i>, in which you generate new data (in this case,
          words), based solely on information about the last piece of data you
          generated. Markov Models are widely employed to solve all sorts of
          problems in Artificial Intelligence research. In fact, many of the
          most widely-used techniques in Natural Language Processing use
          representations of words produced from a process not unlike that which
          you're tasked with implementing in Assignment 6. One of the most
          interesting properties of such models is that they help us to
          construct a statistical model of Natural Language, and to consequently
          make predictions about it. In this problem, you'll explore the
          statistical properties of the model constructed in the Mimic program,
          using only the skills you've already developed as a Python programmer.

            <pre class="shell">
                    <code>

                    </code>

            <code>tale-of-two-cities-sample.txt</code>, produced by running my
            own Mimic solution as follows:
            <!-- <div class="codeblock"> -->

                    <code>
$ python3 mimic.py tale-of-two-cities.txt 1000
                    </code>

        </ul>
        <p>
          Each of the <code>-sample.txt</code> files are approximately 1000
          words and as the assignment handout suggests, should sound like
          they're in the voice of the original text. You'll verify this in this
          problem!
        </p>
        <h4>Collecting statistics</h4>
        <p>
          Your goal in this problem is to write a program that analyses and
          prints the frequency of words in a piece of text. You'll then use the
          program to compare the distributions of word occurrences between a
          piece of text and the output of the Mimic program, run on that piece
          of text. We've provided some basic scaffolding for you in
          <code>stats.py</code>, which you can run like so:
        </p>
        <pre class="shell">
            <code>
$ python3 stats.py alice-book.txt
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Your job is to implement the following function:
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
          <code>def print_most_frequent(filename)</code>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          which takes as a parameter the name of a file and ultimately prints
          the words in the file in ascending order of how frequently they are
          used, as well as their frequency counts. We'll leave your exact
          decompositional strategy up to you, but your program should look
          fairly similar in structure to the Mimic assignment itself.
        </p>
        <h4>Analyzing the Output</h4>
        <p>
          Once you've got the <code>print_most_frequent</code> function (and by
          extension the <code>stats.py</code> program) up and running, it's time
          to use it to examine the frequency distributions of the words in
          various files. For example, run
          <code>python3 stats.py alice-book.txt</code> and
          <code>python3 stats.py alice-sample.txt</code> and compare the
          outputs. Do the two files use the same words the most frequently? If
          not, what might be causing that difference? Is the same true for
          <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>?
        </p>
        <h4>Words of Wisdom</h4>
        <p>
          While we'll leave the actual strategy of decomposition and other
          implementation details largely up to you, here are a few directions
          you could take, some of which I employed in my own solution:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When reading through a file, you can use the
            <code>f.read()</code> function to read the entire text of the file
            as a string and the <code>s.split()</code> function to split that
            string into a list of space-separated tokens.
          </li>
          <li>
            Words might appear in a variety of different cases throughout the
            text (for example, at the beginning of a sentence, they will begin
            with a capital letter). Somehow standardizing the case of the words
            will allow you to produce better distributions of word usage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some words might also end with punctuation marks like full stops,
            exclamation marks, question marks, and semicolons. To deal with this
            this, you might want to detect and remove any punctuation at the end
            of a word.
          </li>
          <li>
            Given a dictionary of word counts, you can get a sortable list of
            key-value tuples like so:
            <pre class="python">
                <code>
word_count_pairs = list(counts.items())
                </code>
            </pre>
            Each of these tuples represents a key and its corresponding value.
            To get the key, you can index into the tuple at position 0 and to
            get the value, you can index into the tuple at position 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            The texts in question have many different words, most of do not
            occur very frequently. When printing out the words and their counts
            in the text, consider only doing so for words that only occur above
            some fixed amount of times to reduce the number of words printed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Moving On </h4>
        <p>
          While you were hopefully able to gain some insights into the language
          model that the Mimic program constructs, there's plenty you can do to
          continue to explore this, if you so choose:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Trying on different texts</i> Try using Mimic to produce samples
            of essays or blog posts you've written, or on other pieces of famous
            literature, or if you're feeling really wild, pieces of Python code.
            What sorts of text does it work well on? On the ones that it doesn't
            work well on, inspect the distributions using
            <code>stats.py</code> to see how they're different. To save the
            output of Mimic to a text file, run it like so:
            <pre class="shell">
                <code>
$ python3 mimic.py &lt;textfile&gt; &lt;limit&gt; &gt; &lt;filename&gt;.txt
                </code>
            </pre>
            and replace any expressions in angle brackets with strings or
            numbers of your own choosing. The results will be stored in
            <code>&lt;filename&gt;.txt</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The approach that Mimic takes to modelling a piece of text is a
            reasonable one, but suffers from a few limitations, as you might be
            able to tell from the nonsensical text it produces. Can you think of
            any? What could you do to fix it?
