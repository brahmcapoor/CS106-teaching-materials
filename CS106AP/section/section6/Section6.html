        <h2>Nested Dictionaries</h2>
        <p>
          To get some practice with dictionaries and nesting collections,
          implement the following functions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>def int_counts(ints)</code> Given a list of integers, create
              and return an int-count dict: that is, each unique integer in
              <code>ints</code>
              is a key in the dictionary and the corresponding value is the
              number of times that integer appeared in the list.

              A suffix is defined as the last 2 characters of a string, and a
              string that is less than 2 characters long has no suffix.

        <h2>Big Tweet Data!</h2>
        <p>
          In this program, you'll write a program that reads through a large
          collection of tweets and store the data to keep track of how hashtags
          occur in tweets. This is a great example of how Python can be used in
          data analysis tasks.

        </p>
        <h4> Our Dataset </h4>
        <p>
          For the purposes of this problem, each tweet is represented as a
          single line of text in a file. Each line consists of the poster's
          username (prefixed by a '@' symbol), followed by a colon and then the
          text of the tweet. Each character in this file can be a character from
          any language, or an emoji, although you don't need to do anything
          special to deal with thse characters. One such file in the PyCharm
          project we provide is <code>small-tweets.txt</code>, which is
          reproduced here:

        <p>
          We provide 3 such files for you in the PyCharm Project:
          <code>small-tweets.txt</code>, <code>big-tweets.txt</code> and
          <code>huge-tweets.txt</code>.
        </p>
        <h4> Building a <code>user_tags</code> Dictionary </h4>
        <p>
          Central to this program is a <code>user_tags</code> dictionary, in
          which each key is a Twitter user's name like
          <code>'@BarackObama'</code>. The value for each key in this dictionary
          is a second, nested dictionary which counts how frequently that
          particular user has used particular hashtags. For example, a very
          simple <code>user_tags</code> dictionary might be:
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
          <code>{'@BarackObama': {'#SCOTUS': 4, '#Obamacare': 3}}</code>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          We'll explore this dictionary in some more detail as we go through
          this problem, but as a matter of nomenclature, we'll call the inner
          dictionary the 'counts' dictionary (since it uses the dict-count
          algorithm we've seen a bunch in class). Our high-level strategy is to
          <b>change</b> the above dict for each tweet we read, so it accumulates
          all the counts as we go through the tweets.
        </p>
        <h5> 1. Warmup questions </h5>
        <p>
          Given the dictionary above, what updates we would make to it in each
          of the following cases?
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We encounter a new tweet that reads
            <code>'@BarackObama: #Obamacare signups now!'</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            We encounter a new tweet that reads
            <code>'@kanyewest: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ https://t.co/KmvxIwKkU6'</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5> 2. Implementing <code>add_tweet</code> </h5>
        <p>
          The add_tweet() function is the core of this whole program, and is
          responsible for performing the update to a
          <code>user_tags</code> dictionary described above. The tests shown
          below represent a sequence, expressed as a series of Doctests. For
          each call, you can see the dictionary that is passed in, and the
          dictionary that is returned on the next line. The first test passes in
          the empty dictionary (<code>{}</code>) and gets back a dictionary with
          1 user and 2 tags. The 2nd test then takes that returned dictionary as
          its input, and so on. Each call adds more data to the
          <code>user_tags</code> dictionary.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're all string parsing experts by now, so we won't make you do that
          work anymore. We've provided you with two functions entitled
          <code>parse_tags</code> and <code>parse_user</code>, both of which
          take as a parameter the tweet in question and return a list of tags in
          the tweet and the username that posted the tweet, respectively.
        </p>
        <pre class="python">
          <code>
def add_tweet(user_tags, tweet):
    """
    Given a user_tags dict and a tweet, parse out the user and tags,
    and add those counts to the user_tags dict which is returned.
    If no user exists in the tweet, return the user_tags dict unchanged.
    Note: call the parse_tags(tweet) and parse_user(tweet) functions to pull
    the parts out of the tweet.
    >>> add_tweet({}, '@alice: #apple #banana')
    {'@alice': {'#apple': 1, '#banana': 1}}
    >>> add_tweet({'@alice': {'#apple': 1, '#banana': 1}}, '@alice: #banana')
    {'@alice': {'#apple': 1, '#banana': 2}}
    >>> add_tweet({'@alice': {'#apple': 1, '#banana': 2}}, '@bob: #apple')
    {'@alice': {'#apple': 1, '#banana': 2}, '@bob': {'#apple': 1}}
    """
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h5> 3. Implementing <code>parse_tweets</code> </h5>
        <p>
          Use <code>add_tweet</code> in a loop to build up and return a
          <code>user_tags</code> dict. This should look mostly like other
          file-reading functions you've written, and your job is to make sure
          you understand how to follow the pattern of creating and updating a
          dictionary suggested by the <code>add_tweet</code> function. Restated,
          the responsibility of <code>add_tweet</code> is to update a
          dictionary, and <code>parse_tweets</code> must create and maintain
          that dictionary as it is updated.
        </p>
        <h4> Running your program </h4>
        <p>
          We provide a <code>main</code> function that calls the
          <code>parse_tweets</code> function you implemented in a variety of
          ways. To use it, run the program from the terminal. Run with just 1
          argument (a data filename), it reads in all the data from that file
          and prints out a summary of each user and all their tweets and counts:
        </p>
        <pre class="shell">
          <code>
$ python3 tweets.py small-tweets.txt
@BarackObama
 #BigBlockOfCheeseDay -> 1
 #SOTU -> 3
@GonzalezSarahA
 #education -> 1
 #vt -> 1
 #realestate -> 1
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          When run with the <code>'-users'</code> argument,
          <code>main</code> prints out all the usernames:
        </p>
        <pre class="shell">
          <code>
$ python3 tweets.py -users small-tweets.txt
users
@BarackObama
@kanyewest
@dog_rates
@GonzalezSarahA
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          When run with the <code>'-user'</code> argument followed by a
          username, the program prints out the data for just that user.
        </p>
        <pre class="shell">
          <code>
$ python3 tweets.py -user @BarackObama small-tweets.txt
user: @BarackObama

        <p>
          You probably won't get to this extension in section, but if you have
          time, implement this additional function which you can then leverage
          to answer some interesting questions about Hashtag use.

        <h4>Implementing <code>flat_counts</code></h4>
        <p>
          It's natural to be curious about how often tags are used across users.
          This function takes in a <code>user_tags</code> dictionary and
          computes a new "flat" count dictionary:
        </p>
        <pre class="python">
          <code>
def flat_counts(user_tags):
    """
    Given a user_tags dicts, sum up the tag counts across all users,
    return a "flat" counts dict with a key for each tag,
    and its value is the sum of that tag's count across users.
    >>> flat_counts({'@alice': {'#apple': 1, '#banana': 2}, '@bob': {'#apple': 1}})
    {'#apple': 2, '#banana': 2}
    """
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          <code>main</code> will call that function with the
          <code>-flat</code> argument, like so:
        </p>
        <pre class="shell">
          <code>
$ python3 tweets.py -flat small-tweets.txt
flat
 #BigBlockOfCheeseDay -> 1
 #MAGA -> 2
 #SOTU -> 3
