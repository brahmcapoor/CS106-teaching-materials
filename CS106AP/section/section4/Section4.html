        <h2>Range & Loop Problems</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          First, we'll go through a series of problems intended to increase your
          familiarity with the additional parameters of the
          <code>range</code> function and nested loops. Implement the following
          functions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>negative(n)</code>: Given a non-negative integer
              <code>n</code>, return a list of all the ints from
              <code>n</code> down to <code>-n</code>, i.e.
              <code>[n, n-1, ..., 1, 0, -1, -2, ..., -n]</code>.
            </p>
            <p class="hint">
              Note: consider the case where <code>n == 0</code>. Does your
              function need to do any special work to account for this
              situation?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>threes(n)</code>: Given a non-negative integer
              <code>n</code>, create and return a list of <code>n</code> lists,
              each of which has length 3. Each inner list should contain 3
              consecutive integers. The first inner list should start with a 1,
              and every subsequent inner list's first element should increase by
              1. For example, <code>threes(4)</code> would return
              <code>[[1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,4,5], [4,5,6]]</code>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>countdown(n)</code>: Given a non-negative integer
            <code>n</code> that is less than or equal to 10, create and return a
            list of <code>n</code> lists, where each inner list counts down from
            10 to successively smaller numbers. For example,
            <code>countdown(3)</code> would return
            <code>[[10], [10, 9], [10, 9, 8]]</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>A much better email parser </h2>
        <p class="no-print">
          Download the PyCharm project <a href="section4.zip">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last week in section, you built a program to retrieve email hostnames
          from a file. Unfortunately, that program was limited in several ways.
          For example, it could only parse a single email from each line of the
          file, only retrieved the hostname of each email, and finally wasn't
          robust to peculiar cases such as punctuation occurring immediately
          after the hostname.
        </p>
        <p>
          This week, you'll leverage your new skills with nested loops and
          string parsing to build a more sophisticated program to grab emails
          from a file. You'll start by writing a program that simply grabs every
          email address from the file by implementing functions which we specify
          and whose definitions we provide for you. Then, you'll make your
          program a little more flexible by having it to support a variety of
          command line arguments which alter its behaviour.
        </p>

        <div class="subproblem">
          <h4> Step 1: Parsing Emails </h4>
          <br />

          <h5>Detecting Valid Characters</h5>
          <p>
            First, we're going to refine our definition of what constitutes an
            email address. An email address must be formatted in the following
            way:
          </p>
          <div class="text-center"> <code>username@hostname</code></div>
          <p>
            Every character in both the username and the hostname must be a
            letter, a digit, a period, a dash, or an underscore (the
            <code>'_'</code> character). The username must be at least one
            character long, and the hostname must be at least 4 characters long,
            one of which is a period. With this in mind, implement the following
            useful helper function:
          </p>
          <div class="text-center"> <code>def is_email_char(ch)</code></div>
          <p>
            that takes in a character, and returns whether that character is a
            valid part of an email address. This will not be a long function,
            but will be instrumental in the readability of the more complex
            functions you write later.
          </p>

          <h5>Getting email addresses from a line</h5>
          <p>Your job here is to implement the following function:</p>
          <div class="text-center"> <code>def get_all_emails(line)</code></div>
          <p>
            Which takes as input a string representing a line of text from a
            file, and returns a list of all the valid email addresses in that
            line.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's some sample output for the
            <code>get_all_emails</code> function:
          </p>
          <pre class="python">
            <code>
>>> get_all_emails('xx aa@bb.com 1.2@3.45')
['aa@bb.com', '1.2@3.45']
>>> get_all_emails('_@_ aa-bb@TV.org**meh@meh.com')
['aa-bb@TV.org', 'meh@meh.com']
>>> get_all_emails('abc @ @ 123')
[]
>>> get_all_emails('')
[]
            </code>
          </pre>
          <div class="hint">
            <p> Some words of wisdom:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You might find it helpful to first find an
                <code>@</code> character in the email, and then scan backwards
                and forwards to find the other characters in the email address.
                As a reminder, the <code>str.find()</code> function accepts an
                optional second parameter which specifies which index to begin
                searching in the string from.
              </li>
              <li>
                Leveraging the <code>is_email_char()</code> function you wrote
                in the previous section will be very helpful here.
              </li>
              <li>
                Remember, the username in an email address must be at least one
                character long and the hostname must be at least 4 characters
                long, with one period.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h5>Getting all the email addresses from a file</h5>
          <p>Finally, implement the following function:</p>
          <div class="text-center">
            <code>def get_emails_from_file(filename)</code>
          </div>
          <p>
            that takes as input a filename for your function to read through and
            returns a sorted list of all the email addresses in the file. For
            example, if the file <code>emails.txt</code> looks like this:
          </p>
          <pre class="text">
              <code>
Hello john@example.com this is alice@microsoft.com
And a.7@d_e.org and a@a.com
brahm@stanford.edu is not nick's email
              </code>
            </pre>
          <p>
            then the function would behave as below:
          </p>
          <pre class="python">
              <code>
>>> get_emails_from_file('emails.txt')
['a.7@d_e.org', 'a@a.com', 'alice@microsoft.com', 'brahm@stanford.edu', 'john@example.com']
              </code>
          </pre>

          <h5>Putting it all together</h5>
          <p>
            We've written a main function for you that puts all of these
            together, so you don't need to worry about modifying it for this
            section.
          </p>
          <pre class="python">
              <code>
def main():
    args = sys.argv[1:]
    if len(args) == 1:
        emails = parse_all_emails(args[0])
        for email in emails:
            print(email)
    # some other bookkeeping here
              </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            You can use your program as demonstrated below:
          </p>
          <pre class="shell">
            <code>
$ python3 emails.py emails.txt
a.7@d_e.org
a@a.com
alice@microsoft.com
brahm@stanford.edu
john@example.com

$ python3 emails.py big-emails.txt
--@
--@and.com
--@bill
--@come
--@oh
--@oh.com
--@the.com
....lots and lots of emails....
you@thinking.com
your@acceptance.com
your@walk
            </code>
          </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="subproblem">
          <h4> Step 2: Command Line Arguments </h4>
          <p>
            Now that you have a basic version of your program working, you'll
            now turn your attention to making it a more flexible and powerful by
            implementing various optional command line options for the user:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>-max</code>: The <code>-max</code> command line option
              allows you to specify the maximum number of emails you'd like to
              grab from each line. For example, if one of the lines in the file
              is
              <code
                >brahm@stanford.edu and nick@stanford.edu and
                chris@stanford.edu</code
              >, but your program is called as below, only
              <code>brahm@stanford.edu</code> and
              <code>nick@stanford.edu</code> should be printed to the terminal.
              <pre class="shell">
                <code>
$ python3 emails.py emails.txt
... emails from other lines in the file ...
brahm@stanford.edu
nick@stanford.edu
chris@stanford.edu
... emails from other lines in the file ...

$ python3 emails.py -max 2 emails.txt
... emails from other lines in the file ...
brahm@stanford.edu
nick@stanford.edu
... emails from other lines in the file ...

                </code>
              </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>-host</code>: The <code>-host</code> command line option
              allows you to specify that you would only like to grab emails with
              a paricular hostname. For example, calling the program as below
              will only print <code>stanford.edu</code> emails in the shell.
              <pre class="shell">
                <code>
$ python3 emails.py emails.txt
carol@avengers.com
brahm@stanford.edu
julia@gmail.com

$ python3 emails.py -host stanford.edu emails.txt
brahm@stanford.edu
                </code>
              </pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can assume that a user will use either the
            <code>-max</code> option, or the <code>-host</code> option, but not
            both.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elegantly supporting both these options is primarily a challenge in
            decomposition and style - there is no one 'correct' way to do it.
            You are free to make whatever modifications you want to the
            program's functions, their parameters and return values. As a
            reference, the sample solution modifies the <code>main</code>,
            <code>get_emails_from_file</code>, and
            <code>get_all_emails</code> functions, although you are welcome to
            pursue an alternative strategy.
