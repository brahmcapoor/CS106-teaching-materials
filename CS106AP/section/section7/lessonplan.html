        Check out the slides for full details, but here's a quick summary of
        everything that went down. In addition, make sure to take a look at the
        exercises students went through in class.

          <p>
            First, we covered the first portion of modules in Python. We
            positioned modules as pieces of code written by the designers of
            Python that are prepackaged up for our convenience and use. We
            covered two specific modules:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>math</code>, specifically the <code>sqrt</code> and
              <code>log10</code> functions, as well as the
              <code>math.pi</code> constant.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>random</code>, specifically the <code>randrange</code> and
              <code>choice</code> functions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Here's a quick example of how to use both of these:
          </p>
          <pre class="python">
              <code>
>>> import random
>>> import math
>>> math.sqrt(4)
2.0
>>> math.log10(1000)
3.0
>>> math.pi
3.141592653589793
>>> random.randrange(0, 2)
1
>>> random.randrange(0, 2)
0
>>> random.randrange(0, 2)
1
>>> random.randrange(0, 2)
1
>>> random.choice(['a', 'b', 'c'])
'b'
>>> random.choice(['a', 'b', 'c'])
'c'
>>> random.choice(['a', 'b', 'c'])
'c'
              </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Following that, we talked about a few new ways to read files,
            summarized below:
          </p>
          <pre class="python">
              <code>
>>> with open(filename, 'r') as f:
>>>     for line in f:
>>>         # process each line

>>> with open(filename, 'r') as f:
>>>     text = f.read() # read the entire file as a single string with newlines

>>> with open(filename, 'r') as f:
>>>     lines = f.readlines() # read each line of the file into a list
              </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Finally, we spent some time talking about algorithmic style and how
            it can actually speed up the functionality of our programs. Check
            out the lecture slides for an example of this.

              Lecture 21: Tuples and <code>lambda</code>s
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            We began by talking about Tuples, a new data type that you might not
            have seen before. A tuple is a fixed-length sequence of objects that
            is itself immutable (importantly, its members need not be immutable:
            the tuple simply contains immutable references to its members). A
            tuple is defined using surrounding parentheses, like so:
          </p>
          <div class="text-center">
            <code>tup = (1, 2, 3)</code>
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            (For completeness, the parentheses aren't actually <i>necessary</i>,
            and omitting them would have the same effect. That said, we're
            considering that bad style, since it should be clear that a tuple is
            being employed. )
          </p>
          <p>
            We talked about a bunch of cool Tuple features, which are outlined
            below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When sorting lists of tuples, they are sorted first by their first
              elements, and then by subsequent elements to break ties, like so:
              <pre class="python">
                  <code>
>>> pairs = [('stanford.edu', '/meh'), ('google.com','/search'),
('stanford.edu', '/admit'), ('google.com', '/aardvark')]
>>> pairs
[('stanford.edu', '/meh'), ('google.com', '/search'), ('stanford.edu', '/admit'), ('google.com', '/aardvark')]
>>> sorted(pairs)
[('google.com', '/aardvark'), ('google.com', '/search'), ('stanford.edu', '/admit'), ('stanford.edu', '/meh')]
                  </code>
              </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              We can also leverage the mechanisms of tuple <i>unpacking</i>, by
              which Python can automatically decompress a tuple into a
              collection of elements which can be stored in variables
              individually, like so:
              <pre class="python">
                  <code>
>>> x, y = (42, 100)
>>> x
42
>>> y
100
                  </code>
              </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, when we're working with a dictionary, we can call its
              <code>.items()</code> method to get what essentially is a list of
              key-value tuples that allows us to iterate over the dictionary in
              a truly elegant manner:
            </li>
            <pre class="python">
                <code>
>>> dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 42}
>>> dict.items()
dict_items([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 42)])
>>> for key, value in dict.items():
        print(key, value)
a 1
b 2
c 42
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
              As a quick addendum, <code>.items()</code> returns the elements of
              the dictionary in insertion order.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, we moved on to talking about <code>lambda</code> functions.
              These are a little complex and if you haven't encountered them
              before (either in Python or another language), make sure to review
              this section carefully. Much of this was abstracted away from
              students, but I think it's important for you to have some
              familiarity with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Python, functions are what is known as
              <i>first class citizens</i>, which means that just like other
              values, they can be stored in variables, passed as parameters and
              even returned from functions. Thus, that means you can do
              something like this, in which we sort a dictionary's
              <code>items</code>
              by their values:
            </p>
            <pre class="python">
                <code>
>>> def get_value_from_tuple(key_value_pair):
>>>    return key_value_pair[1]

>>> d = # some random dict
>>> sorted_items = sorted(d.items(), key=get_value_from_tuple)
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
              The interesting line here is the call to <code>sorted</code>,
              which takes the additional <code>key</code> parameter
              (incidentally, this parameter is called an optional
              <i>keyword argument</i>, meaning that it doesn't need to be
              specified, but if it is specified, it must be prefaced by
              <code>key=</code>). This parameter specifies a function (in this
              case <code>get_value_from_tuple</code>) that is called on
              <i>each member of <code>d.items()</code></i
              >. The values that are thus sorted are those returned by the key,
              rather than the values in the collection themselves. Note that
              we're passing in <code>get_value_from_tuple</code> as a parameter,
              rather than <code>get_value_from_tuple()</code>. The former passes
              in the function itself, whereas the latter <i>calls</i> the
              function and passes in the return value to <code>sorted</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that in mind, the working definition we provided to students
              of <code>lambda</code> functions is that they are a way of
              specifying the parameters and return values of a function without
              having to explicitly name it (in fact, the technical nomenclature
              for a <code>lambda</code> is an <code>anonymous function</code>).
              The code sample above could be rewritten as follows:
            </p>
            <pre class="python">
                <code>
>>> # we're not defining get_value_from_tuple() here
>>> d = # some random dict
>>> sorted_items = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
              The important portion of this code is
              <code>lambda item: item[0]</code>, which defines a lambda function
              that takes in a parameter called <code>item</code> and returns the
              1st element of <code>item</code>. Similar to the previous code
              example, each time a comparison is made in the sorting algorithm,
              it calls the <code>lambda</code> function (passing in a single
              key-value pair), and compares whatever the
              <code>lambda</code> returns.
            </p>
            <p>
              In general, the body of a lambda function looks as follows:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <code>lambda parameter : return value</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Thus far, we've only been discussing lambdas that take in one
              parameter. Notice also that we don't need to explicitly
              <code>return</code> anything - the expression following the colon
              is implicitly returned.
            </p>
            <p>
              A student might ask you whether there are any functional reasons a
              lambda function is better suited to a task than a normal function
              defined using <code>def</code>. There are few reasons one might be
              a better functional decision than the other but many stylistic
              considerations apply:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A function defined using <code>def</code> lends itself better to
                side effects like printing. Conversely, it's easier to guarantee
                that a lambda function doesn't have inadvertent side effects
                (although it's certainly not impossible).
              </li>
              <li>
                A lambda function reduces the amount of cruft in your code, by
                reducing the number of simple functions you need to write.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              That said, for the sake of completeness, the following two
              functions are defined differently but are exactly equivalent, even
              if we'd never use the second way:
            </p>
            <pre class="python">
                <code>
>>> def option_1(x):
>>>    return x * 2

>>> option_2 = lambda x : x * 2

>>> option_1(42)
84
>>> option_2(42)
84
                </code>
            </pre>
          </ul>

            This lecture hasn't happened yet, but we'll be discussing the use of

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>
        I'll start by saying that this week's section handout is
        <i>
          absolutely mammoth, and there is no expectation for you to get through
          more than one or two of the problems </i
        >. Most of this bulk comes from additional practice problems or
        exercises that students themselves have requested, and so I'm entirely
        comfortable with suggesting that students work through most of it
        themselves. I've been encouraging students I've been interacting with to
        practice each week, rather than marathoning all the content before the
        final and this handout facilitates that endeavour. The problems I
        strongly recommend working in section through are
        <b>Grid Drawing</b> and <b>Sorting with <code>lambda</code>s</b>: these
        are the problems most immediately relevant to assignment 7 as well as
        the foundational for all the other problems in the handout. That said,
        here's a summary of each of the problems. Many of them have starter code
        you can download, and if you have a projector in your room, might be
        cool to live code (especially the graphics problems).
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Grid Drawing</b>: This is a great problem to introduce students
            to <code>tkinter</code> (prounounced 'tk-inter', by the way). The
            goal is to have them reason about how the python they've learned can
            lend itself to a graphical context that will hopefully appear
            obviously useful. Note that we provide the
            <code>make_canvas</code> function to students (which we will usually
            do), so they only need to worry about adding the appropriate
            graphical objects to the screen. We've set up a few milestones for
            students to follow as well.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Random Circles</b>: This is an additional practice problem for
            students to tackle graphics programs. This also gives students some
            practice with using the <code>random</code> module. Importantly,
            students will probably not see how to draw circles in
            <code>tkinter</code> in lecture, so be sure to go over the syntax.
            Essentially, you need to spcify the top left and bottom right
            coordinates of the bounding box.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Sorting with <code>lambda</code>s</b>: A bunch of quick puzzles
            to work through to make students familiar with
            <code>lambda</code> functions and using <code>sorted</code>. Be sure
            to work through these yourself first.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Tweets Revisited</b>: An extension on the tweets projects from
            last section. Students should have worked through the entire tweets
            project (including the extension) before doing this problem.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Pynary bomb</b>: I included this problem almost entirely because
            it's an incredible pun, but it's also a vicious trace problem that's
            entirely worth a student working through in their own time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Analyzing Mimic Output</b>: Several students have expressed
            interest in more meaningful data-analysis type projects, and this is
            a program that students write to convince themselves that pieces of
            text produced by the Mimic program have similar language
            distributions to the original corpus. THis is mostly for working
            through outside of section, but if you have time, this is a cool
            thing to discuss. Big thanks to Sheridan for suggesting a problem
            like this!
