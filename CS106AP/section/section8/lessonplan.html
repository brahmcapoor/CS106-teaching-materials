      <h2>Lecture and Concepts Recap</h2>
      <p>
        This isn't ordered by lecture, but here's a general summary of
        everything that went down, or will go down by the end of Wednesday's
        class and which might come up in section:
      </p>
      <h4>Floats</h4>
      <p>
        We went over the <code>float</code> data type, which is a lot like the
        <code>double</code> datatype in Java and C++ in that it represents
        arbitrary decimals. You shouldn't get too many questions about this, but
        remember that floats are definitionally a little imprecise once you get
        15 digits in (see lecture slides for examples of this).
      </p>
      <h4>Modules</h4>
      <p>
        We discussed the notions of modules in Python. A module (which is
        basically the formal name for any <code>.py</code> file), allows you
        encapsulate a particular group of variables and functions (and classes,
        although that's not relevant to 106A) such that they can be imported
        into another module. You can import prewritten modules -- such as
        <code>math</code> and <code>urllib</code> -- but can also define your
        own. For example, suppose you have the following code in
        <code>mycoolmodule.py</code>:
      </p>
      <pre class="python">
          <code>
def foo(n, m):
    # sick code here
    return n + 2

def bar():
    # more sick code here
          </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        You could leverage the module in another script, like so:
      </p>
      <pre class="python">
        <code>
import mycoolmodule  # must be same name as the .py file

def main():
    print(mycoolmodule.foo(42))
    mycoolmodule.bar()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h4> List Comprehensions </h4>
      <p>
        List Comprehensions -- my personal favorite part of Python -- are a
        piece of syntactical sugar used to succinctly and expressively construct
        lists of elements. It's inspired by
        <a href="https://www.mathwords.com/s/set_builder_notation.htm">
          set builder notation
        </a>
        <span class="only-print"> set builder notation </span>, a mathematical
        shorthand for expressing the elements of sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        A list comprehension essentially produces a list by iterating over the
        elements of some collection, applying some (optional) operation to each
        element, possibly filtering the elements and adding them to a list.
        That's a lot to take in, but is all expressed quite succinctly using
        this general format:
      </p>
      <div class="text-center">
        <code>
          [&lt;operation(e)&gt; for e in &lt;original collection&gt; &lt;if
          predicate(e)&gt;]
        </code>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        Where each of the parts in brackets (except the
        <code>if predicate</code>, which is optional based on whether or not you
        want to filter the elements) should be substituted for valid python
        code. For example, if you wanted to find the first 100 squares, you
        would do so as follows:
      </p>
      <pre class="python">
        <code>
>>> [i * i for i in range(100)]
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ..., 9801]       # lots of output elided
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        If you wanted to do the same thing for just the even numbers, you would
        adjust the comprehension by adding a predicate:
      </p>
      <pre class="python">
        <code>
>>> [i * i for i in range(100) if i % 2 == 0]
[0, 4, 16, ..., 9604]             # lots of output elided
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        You could also go wild and mix up your types:
      </p>
      <pre class="python">
        <code>
>>> d = {'Xyz': 50, 'abc': 42, 'xabc': 1000}
>>> [len(k) for k in d.keys() if k.lower()[0] == 'x']
[3, 4]
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Those examples should hopefully provide you with enough of a working
        understanding of list comprehensions to teach section, but if you'd like
        to delve deeper into them (which I strongly recommend), I'd check out

      </p>
      <h4> Jupyter Notebooks </h4>
      <p>
        The absolute best thing for you to do here if you're unfamiliar with
        them is to actually work through the lecture examples as well as the
        section material, and to let Brahm know if you have any questions.

        THat said, I'll quickly provide a summary of the messaging you can use
        when talking about Jupyter notebooks:
      </p>
      <p>
        Python, as a general purpose programming language, can be used in a
        surfeit of different contexts. One incredibly popular use is as an
        analytic tool, which allows even non-technical users to -- with only a
        small amount of easy-to-understand code -- engage with large amounts of
        data and to visualize it. A Jupyter notebook is a programming
        environment that lends itself particularly well to that kind of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can think of a Jupyter notebook as a complete Python program, which
        is divided into sections by portions of text and images. The text can
        provide a summary of or context for the code you've written, and the
        images can be visualizations provided by your code. You are able to run
        each piece of code (called a 'cell') separately, so that you can iterate
        on individual parts of your code without having to rerun all of it every
        time (meaning, for example, you can do the time-intensive file reading
        once) and then quickly change the functions you call on that data.
      </p>
      <h2>This week's section</h2>
      <p>
        This is your last section ðŸ˜­
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this week's section is to get student's familiar with the
        kinds of code that they'll need to write for assignment 8, chief among
        them Jupyter Notebooks and list comprehensions. Because this is also the
        last section, the Jupyter Notebooks problem is also a pretty cool
        problem in which students graph the heart rates of various people. Do
        the Jupyter Notebooks problem first, before moving onto the one-liners
        problem if you have time. Don't worry about the debugger problem -
        that's there for students to engage with in their own time if they want.
